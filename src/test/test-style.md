# Style For Writing Tests

* Test classes should have names ending with â€œTestâ€�

* Test classes should be in this directory, separated from the source file

* Ideally they will be in packages named as those in the source file 

_ e.g. The test class for Key.java will be named KeyTest.java and located in a package called test.nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.gp20.maze.tiles in the src-test folder _

## Test Coverage Required

* __Maze__ 80%

* __Persistence__ 80 %

* Tests are not required for graphical representations
